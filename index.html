  <section class="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Joe. I work on websites and other types of coding projects. I have a willingness to learn new
      technologies and grow my skillset as a developer. This portfolio will showcase some of the skills I have learned
      on the way.</p>
    <p>Currently, I live in the Portland Oregon area. I attend Epicodus and work with a medical staffing network part
      time on the weekends. Once my schooling is finished, I intend to throw all of my efforts into finding the right
      job for me and my family. Please take a look at my <a
        href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-barnes-6a2079a6">LinkedIn Page</a> For more information on my resume and
      work experience!</p>

  <section class="hobbies">
    <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
    <p>Learning to become a web developer/programmer leaves little time for many outside activites. However, I do enjoy Music, movies, and gaming.</p>
    <p>First off I am a musician. I have studied music since gradeschool, and have played in several orchestral units and <em>"garage bands."</em> I started off playing trumpet at the age of 10 and moved on to other instruments. Currently, I am adept at guitar, and have a slight knowledge of most woodwind instruments, percussion and brass. I declined going to school for music when I was in highschool. It didn't feel like the path I wanted to go down. It has always been a hobby, nothing more </p>
    <p>I am also a big movie person. I have high intrests in horror specifically. If I would be picked upon to list my favorite horror movies, I would have to put Alien and The Shining at the top. I'm always trying to discover new and obscure genres of horror. There are so many to choose from. </p>
    <p>Lastly, I do game. Not nearly as much as I used to. However, on occasion I will sit down and enjoy the occasional RPG. I'm not one for shooter titles or acation games. I love a good story. If it has captivating characters and interesting settings, I'm there.</p>
