    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Joe. I work on websites and other types of coding projects. I have a willingness to learn new technologies and grow my skillset as a developer. This portfolio will showcase some of the skills I have learned on the way.</p>
    <p>Currently, I live in the Portland Oregon area. I attend Epicodus and work with a medical staffing network part time on the weekends. Once my schooling is finished, I intend to throw all of my efforts into finding the right job for me and my family. Please take a look at my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-barnes-6a2079a6">LinkedIn Page</a> For more information on my resume and work experience!</p>
